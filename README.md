**TFTP Router Flasher** is a cross-platform command-line tool for flashing firmware to routers using the TFTP protocol. It is designed to assist in firmware recovery for routers that support TFTP-based rescue modes, such as many ASUS RT-series models.

This tool is a modern rewrite of the original [arescue](https://github.com/jnissin/arescue) script by [Joonas Nissinen](https://github.com/jnissin). It has been updated for Python 3, refactored for clarity, and packaged as a CLI utility with improved logging, interface detection, and dependency management.

## 🛠️ Build Requirements

<details>
<summary>Click to expand Linux setup instructions</summary>

TFTP Router Flasher depends on Python packages like `psutil` that include native C extensions. To install successfully, your system must have:

- A C compiler (e.g. `gcc`)
- Python development headers (e.g. `Python.h`)
- Build tools (e.g. `make`, `binutils`)

### 🐧 Linux Setup Instructions

#### ✅ Debian / Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential python3-dev
```

#### ✅ CentOS / RHEL / Fedora
```bash
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
sudo dnf install python3-devel
```

#### ✅ Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel python
```

#### ✅ Void Linux
```bash
sudo xbps-install -S base-devel python3-devel
```

Once these are installed, you can run:

```bash
pip install .
```

Or, if you're using a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
```
